##refmt-web
###

This was mostly an experiment to see if we could get refmt compiled to run on the web.  It is unmaintained, so I'd suggest going to take a look at @rickyvetter's awesome [reason-tools](https://github.com/rickyvetter/reason-tools) browser extension project.  I use it all the time and it works great :)
