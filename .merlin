# [merlin](https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) is a static analyser for
# OCaml that provides autocompletion, jump-to-location, recoverable syntax
# errors, type errors detection, etc., that your editor can use. To activate it,
# one usually provides a .merlin file at the root of a project, describing where
# the sources and artifacts are. Since we dictated the project structure, we can
# auto generate .merlin files!

# S is the merlin flag for source files
S .

# Include all the third-party sources too.
#S ./node_modules/**/src

# B stands for build (artifacts). We generate ours into _build

B .

# PKG lists packages found through ocamlfind (findlib), a utility for finding
# the location of third-party dependencies. For us, all third-party deps reside
# in `node_modules/`. One of the exceptions being js_of_ocaml. So we pass it to
# PKG here and let ocamlfind find its source instead.
PKG js_of_ocaml

# FLG is the set of flags to pass to Merlin, as if it used ocamlc to compile and
# understand our sources. You don't have to understand what these flags are for
# now; but if you're curious, go check the jengaroot.ml that generated this
# .merlin.
